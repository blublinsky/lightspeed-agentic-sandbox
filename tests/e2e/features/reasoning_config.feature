  Scenario: Run succeeds with reasoning configured
    Given the sandbox service is running with reasoning configured
    When I run the agent with a simple reasoning query
    Then the run completes successfully
    And success is true
    And the response has a non-empty summary
    And the response summary contains the reasoning answer

  Scenario: Reasoning does not break structured output
    Given the sandbox service is running with reasoning configured
    And a flat output schema with required fields has been prepared
    When I run the agent with the prepared schema and query
    Then the run completes successfully
    And success is true
    And the response JSON validates against the output schema
